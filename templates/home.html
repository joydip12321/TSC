            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4 text-justify">
                I am deeply honored to step into the vital role of Vice Chancellor at Jashore University of Science and
                Technology (JUST), Jashore, Bangladesh. As I begin this message, I would like to pay profound tribute to
                our revered martyrs and national heroes, whose sacrifices span from the Language Movement of 1952 to the
                Anti-Discrimination Student Movement of 2024. I also acknowledge the sacrifices of those who were
                injured in these movements and are now living in indescribably difficult conditions. Without their
                unconditional sacrifices, we would not have the freedom to speak in our mother tongue, Bangla, enjoy an
                independent and sovereign country, or have the opportunity to reclaim our democratic rights in this
                beloved nation.
                <br><br>
                The vision of JUST is to become a leading center of excellence in education, research, and innovation,
                contributing to the advancement of knowledge and society both nationally and globally. In line with this
                vision, JUST's mission is to provide high-quality education, foster groundbreaking research, and drive
                societal development through science and technology. As Vice Chancellor, I am committed to championing
                progressive ideas, a spirit of freedom, a strong conscience, and liberal thinking. However, JUST's
                vision extends beyond educating students; it aims to shape them into professional leaders who will
                contribute to national and global communities, tackling the challenges of the Fourth Industrial
                Revolution. We are dedicated to maintaining a curriculum and research agenda that address societal
                needs, equipping our students with the skills, knowledge, innovation, technology, and ethics to make
                meaningful contributions to the world.
                <br> <br>
                I am thrilled to share that JUST, committed to excellence as an institution, has recently been ranked
                among the top five universities in Bangladesh, placing within the 801-1000 bracket in the prestigious
                'Times Higher Education' World University Rankings for 2025. JUST has also showcased its strength in
                research and innovation, with notable accomplishments such as having faculty members listed among the
                World's Top 2% 'Most Cited Scientists' and receiving prestigious recognition at both national and
                international levels. These achievements reflect our collective dedication to academic excellence,
                innovation, and impactful contributions.
                <br> <br>
                As we move forward, I encourage and urge all teachers, students, staff, and stakeholders to unite in
                fostering an enriched learning environment and advancing our research initiatives. Let us work together
                to shape a university that embodies our shared aspirations and serves as a beacon of progress and
                opportunity for Bangladesh and beyond. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all teachers, students, and
                staff for your unwavering dedication to the growth and success of JUST. Together, we will achieve
                remarkable milestones and excellence in education, research, and innovation.
